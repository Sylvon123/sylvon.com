    <ul>
    <li><h3>Java program structure;</li> Java programs are made up of a collection of classes. Java classes have two roles: a class can either be a description of a type of object, or a collection of static methods (or it can combine both roles). A method consists of a signature followed by a list of statements.
 <li><h3>statements, values and variables;</li> Simple Java statements may be variable declarations, assignments and calls to void-returning methods. It is important to distinguish between statements, which do something, and values which do nothing on their own but are assigned to variables in assignments or passed as arguments to methods (to confuse things, some value do do something - called a side-effect).
    <li><h3>Control structures;</li>The statements in a method are obeyed one at a time in order, but a statement may be a compound statement containing statements within it. When a selection statement is obeyed, only some of the statements within it are obeyed, when a loop statement is obeyed, the statements within in it may be obeyed several times.
        <li><h3>Objects and methods;</li> An object consists of a collection of variables known as fields. A method which has access to an object, either because it constructed it or was passed it as a parameter can generally only interact with that object by calling the object's methods. A class describes an object in terms of the fields and methods it has.
